# scheduler
Inspired by common industry problems that deal with using a limited resource (for example: hotel, flight booking, and room scheduling), our Haskell service provides various information about interval data such as conflict detection and resource use minimisation.

## Instructions
In the root directory make a time interval file representing a single 24 hour day file following the format of test.txt.
Run the following commands:

1) ```ghci```
2) ```:l main```
3) ```main```

Your data analysis result will be computed and stored in: output.txt
